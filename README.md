Features:  

- Quick and easy browsing of restaurants, bars, and more in your location, or whatever location you enter.

- Prominent display of restaurant categories to encourage exploring new cuisine.

- Is a PWA (progressive web app) so you can install it to your phoneâ€™s home screen and enjoy a native app feel and look.

- Built-in navigation to take you to your destination. The built-in navigation is minimalistic at this point lacking turn-by-turn directions or auto-rerouting as you commute, but can be useful when you are familiar with the area you are in.

- For the built-in navigation, manual re-routing when you go off course is implemented. Click the navigation button (or the home button) you clicked to start navigation. This is far less than ideal and unadvised to do while you are driving as the buttons are small, but it demonstrates the re-routing that will happen when automatic re-routing is implemented in the future.

- You can launch Google Maps navigation by clicking the business address in the business detail modal for a more robust navigation solution (open with the details button, by double-clicking the card for the business, or clicking the business name on the mission or report card).

- Menu, website, and delivery links in the business detail modal when available. And always available is the magnifying glass icon to launch a Google search for the business as well as a link to Yelp for the business.

- Create missions of businesses you want to visit so you can remember to experience the things you find interesting. Or create missions to share a curated list with others.

- Mission control page to see all the missions you created, the locations of the businesses on your missions, to launch navigation for those saved businesses, see the details of those businesses, and to manage your missions.

- Missions page with search options to find interesting missions in your location.

- Mission Reports page with search to see what businesses or missions other gastronauts have reviewed in your area.

- Customizable profile page to display your missions and mission reports.

Note: If the built-in navigation routes you in the wrong direction upon navigation start when you are stopped, begin driving then click the navigation button again to re-route. It should detect your heading and display a route starting in the direction you are traveling.
